# Text2SQL: Natural Language to SQL Query Generation

Text2SQL is a natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at automatically generating SQL queries from human-readable text. This project focuses on developing a system architecture and algorithms to facilitate seamless conversion of natural language queries into structured SQL queries. The system comprises both frontend and backend components, ensuring efficient communication, enhanced security, and robust query generation.

#Objective
The primary objective of Text2SQL is to simplify database interaction by enabling users to query databases using natural language, thereby enhancing accessibility and efficiency, especially for non-technical users. The system aims to streamline data retrieval and analysis processes by automating the generation of semantically correct SQL queries from textual input.

#System Architecture and Algorithms - Frontend
- Interactive Frontend Powered by Flask:
Utilizing Flask, users can interact with the platform through a dynamic chat window, enabling the input of natural language queries.
- Efficient Communication Management:
Flask establishes API endpoints to facilitate seamless interaction with the backend.
AJAX communication ensures real-time updates, enhancing user experience.
- Enhanced Security:
Priority is given to implementing security measures to safeguard against potential threats, ensuring the comprehensive Text-to-SQL system.

#System Architecture and Algorithms - Backend
- Fine-tune T5 (small) to translate from Natural Language to SQL:
Utilizing the HuggingFace Seq2Seq transformers based T5 model, fine-tuning is performed on the Spider dataset.
- Dataset Preparation:
Loading the Spider dataset, which contains natural language to SQL query pairs.
Formatting the dataset to suit the requirements of the T5 model.
Tokenizing the data for training, ensuring compatibility with the model architecture.
- Training Configuration:
Setting up training arguments for the T5 model, including batch size, learning rate, and other hyperparameters.
Configuring training parameters to optimize model performance and convergence.

#Getting Started
To run the Text2SQL system locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
- Launch the Flask application by running python app.py.
- Access the application through a web browser and start interacting with the chat window.
